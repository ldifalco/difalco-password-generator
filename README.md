Welcome to my password generator!


For this assignment, I made an actively working password generator.  This will serve to create a very customizable password, with the size varying from 8-128 characters, and character choices including: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. When the user selects generate password, they will be prompted with these choices and then a random password will be shown that follows their choices.  This was done through using javascript to build prompts, alerts, and variables.  

This assignment has helped me in my struggle with grasping javascript, which I am still struggling through.  This was as step in the right direction for sure. The biggest challenge for me was to get my prompts to populate on screen for the user using return statements.  Once I got a handle on that, getting through the rest of the project was much easier.
